# Getting Started

The TTS API establishes the connection using the HTTPS protocol. It uses standard HTTP codes, authentication, and verbs. It will allow you to synthesize high-quality spoken audio in multiple formats. You’ll always receive audio data or an error message in the same HTTP transaction.

The `REV-APPNAME` parameter in the Header will identify the requested API. The API will recognize the default settings like languages, SSML tag settings by the `REV-APP-ID`, and `REV-API-KEY` for each customer account.
> **Note:** _On receiving your request, the_ `REV-APP-ID` _and the_ `REV-API-KEY` are forwarded to your email ID to test the API.
